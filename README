# README FILE
# Introduction to Machine Learning
# Assignment 2
#
# After completing the assignment, fill in this README file.  It asks you to duplicate
# your answer to several questions.  Be certain that your answers in this README file
# (which will be used for auto-grading) match the answers in your PDF writeup.
#
# This README file is formatted in YAML to allow it to be machine readable.  Please
# be very careful with how you edit it, being careful to following the formatting.
# Make certain not to change any text in all UPPERCASE.  After editing, you can make 
# certain that your README file follows proper YAML syntax by running it through an
# online YAML checker, such as http://yaml-online-parser.appspot.com/
# 
# The most frequent error is multi-line strings, such as "SOURCESCONSULTED" and 
# "FEEDBACK_ERRORS".  Make certain that the previous line ends with a | followed by a 
# newline.  Then, make certain that the subsequent lines are indented one level in 
# (4 spaces).  This sounds complex, but just follow the existing format of this file.
# If you run into any problems that you can't fix easily in listing your sources or 
# providing feedback on the assignment, just include your multi-line string answers to
# these parts as comments.  Everything else (all simple one-word or numeric answers) must
# be properly formatted YAML.

# Answer to Implementation Exercise 2.3:  Analysis of the regularization parameter
#######################################################################################

# Copy and paste your brief paragraph describing the effect of the regularization 
# parameter from your PDF.
LOGREGIMPLEMENTATION_REGULARIZATION_ANALYSIS:
 As I increased the value of lambda, I observed that the decision surface moves towards one of the classes, and shifts significantly for big values of lambda. This is because of increased dependency of gradient function on lambda, due to increase in the value of lambda. Therefore, as lambda increases, more regularized values are generated even though the probabilities scope is wider with more uncertain values.

# Answer to Implementation Exercise 3.4:  Effect of Kernel Parameters
#######################################################################################

# Copy and paste your brief paragraph describing the effect of varying the kernel  
# parameters and C from your PDF.
SVM_KERNELPARAMETEREFFECTS:
  As C increased, I observed that the polynomial kernel classifies more instances correctly in the training data. As d increased, I observed that it took more complicated shape for better accommodation according to test data. In case d is extremely big, the training error is very close to 0 but there is overfitting. As C increased, I observed that the Gaussian kernel, keeping sigma constant, the class in blue color started to expand, and classifier was doing a better job for this set but it was reducing the generalizing capability of classifier. As sigma increased, I observed that the different classes (red, brown, blue) took more straighter shapes i.e, the boundaries of these classes were straightening. For values of sigma less than 1, classifier was getting better and better, and training error was reducing.
